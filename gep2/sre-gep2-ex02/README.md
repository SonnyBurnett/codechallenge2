## Expert Assignment 1
### Assignment 1: Experts
1. Before you start download the file inputs.csv from 
https://www.henrybeen.nl/wpcontent/uploads/2020/10/002-experts.txt
2. Write a program that:
    1. Contains a number of classes for moddelling a game of Tic Tac Toe
    2. Reads a tic-tac-toe board from the three lines in inputs.txt
    3. Writes a file outputs.csv that contains one line with the one of the following, first applicable:\
        1\. WINNER X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. NEXTMOVE X\
        2\. WINNER O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. NEXTMOVE
        
Remember, the goal of the assignment: write an OO implementation that solves the problem,
but mostly shows off your OO skills. Do not focus only solving the problem.
