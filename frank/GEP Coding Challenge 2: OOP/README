Unfortunately I haven't been able to fully complete the assignments. 
During the first week I finished most of the work on both the beginners assignment in Python as the expert assignment in Java. My intention was to finish both in the second week, 
but in the end I lacked the time. You might consider this as the semi-products of the first sprint, to be completed in the second sprint.

Java: I'm not a core Java developer, but I have completed 2 Java trainings severals years ago and I tried to the expert assignment to exercise and refresh my Java skills.

Python: since I started with Python in the first Coding Challenge, I wanted to do the beginners assignment as well in order to maintain the Python skills.
